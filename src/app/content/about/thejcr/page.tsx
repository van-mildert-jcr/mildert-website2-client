        The JCR comprises and represents (primarily) undergraduate students at
        Mildert. Through the JCR, students organise sports clubs, societies,
        events, charity work and much more. The JCR also provides many services
        and facilities to its members.

        University can be a stressful time. Durham degrees are challenging.
        Moving to a new place and making new friends can be terrifying. Talk and
        Support provides welfare and support to all Mildert students throughout
        their time at Durham, whether that{"'"}s listening to worries in
        confidence, signposting to University or NHS support, giving out free
        sexual health supplies or just a sit down with a cup of tea and a
        biscuit. Cake and furry animals have also been known to make appearances
        during exam time. üêá

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p className="lead">
        The JCR runs the College Shop, and Technical Committee.

      <p>The JCR also has strong links with the College Bar.</p>

        The Shop, Bar and Tech Comm provide employment opportunities for

      <h2>Other Common Rooms</h2>

        The JCR is one of three common rooms at Mildert along with the{" "}

          MCR

      <p>
        The JCR also works with other JCRs across Durham to support each other
        and ensure that student voices are heard.

        <h2>Final details...</h2>
        <h3>What is the JCR not?</h3>
        <p>This is sometimes a cause of confusion for new students.</p>
        <p>
          The JCR is central to the College community and works very closely
          with College, but the JCR is not College.
          <br />
          Matters such as college food, accommodation, buildings and grounds;
          fees and finance; discipline; and academic progression are down to
          College/the University. The JCR will support and represent students
          with these matters but we cannot change the food, replace your light
          bulb or buy your block a new oven!
