      <h3>
        When do they take place?
      </h3>
      <p>
        They usually take place during the first week of the university&rsquo;s Easter holiday, around the last week in
        March, however please check both our website and the general University social media channels for details closer
        to the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer three open days, usually the Monday, Tuesday and the Wednesday, with students able to stay either on
        the Monday night or the Tuesday night.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What happens during the Open Days?
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you plan on staying overnight, normally you will arrive at around 3pm. We will be waiting at the station for
        you if you choose to get the train, so don&rsquo;t worry about finding your way to college!
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get to college, you will be shown to your room by one of our Open Day Reps. They will be on hand
          during the whole time you stay with us to answer any questions you may have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities will be on until dinner, where you will be sat with fellow applicants to your course, and a representative
        who also studies your subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        After dinner, we usually host some corridor events to give you the chance to meet some people you may meet
        if you do decide to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the evening, we host a bar quiz and the bar will be open (ID is required!). We normally finish the
        evening with some chilled events as well as a fantastic silent disco. This allows you to really experience all
        aspects of life at Mildert, to see if you think you will fit in with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day after breakfast, Reps will escort you down to your subject talks, which take place until
        around midday. These are organized by the university, so you will need to look on the department websites for
        more information about these.
