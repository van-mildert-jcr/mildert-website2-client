        Freshers' week is an exciting and hectic time, stuffed to the brim with activities for Freshers to get to know
        the college, university and their peers. It's a scary time, and we've all been through it, so here's a bit of
        advice to get you through those first few weeks!

                  University is a big change from school and we know that. As Freps, we are here to support
                  and help you. If you have a problem, trust us to give you a hand and don't think you have to
                  go it alone. We're here for you.

                <p>
                  There are lots of events and activities at Mildert, advertising societies, sports and more.
                  The great thing about college is that you don't need to have touched a ball in your life to
                  try out a new sport or have acting experience to join MildARTS. Try out something new and
                  don't be scared to give it all a go!

                <p>
                  Freshers' week caters for all. From the all-night party goers to the 9pm breakfast-tea club,
                  there are social events available for everyone. Don't feel pressured to go out or stay in if
                  you don't want to, because there will be plenty of people who are feeling the same as you
                  who you can get to know at the events that suit YOU.

              room with something cute, white tack is an essential. Note only one accomodation block (Wear) has pin-boards,
              with the exception of some rooms in Tees block.
