  <p>
    Van Mildert JCR Technical Committee is a team of people who deliver sound, lighting and staging for events in College. We are an open committee, meaning anyone can get involved - the only prerequisite is attending a training session and completing some E-Learning. It’s a great opportunity to learn a new skill set and get involved in College events. As well as being paid for the work you do, you’re entitled to free tickets for the events you help deliver. Technical Committee is led by the Head of Tech, and is one of the JCR’s Commercial Services that fall under the remit of the FACSO.
