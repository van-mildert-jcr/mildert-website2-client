              We are very lucky to have one of the best kept tennis courts of all the colleges. In an ideal location
              out of the wind and away from the public eye, this tennis court can be booked at reception. Leave
              your campus card as a deposit when your slot begins and you'll be loaned the key in return!

              It is definitely a good idea to book in advance, as it often gets busy after exams and during sunny spells!
