        At Mildert, we're very lucky to have a recording studio on site, as well as 2 music practice rooms. Both of
        these facilities are available to all Van Mildert students free of charge - bookings made at reception (around
        events time they get very busy).
        <br/>
        The suite is available for use by any Music Department student (but no-one seems to realise this). Music
        students have priority on weekdays (9am -6pm) and Mildert students at all other times.
        <br/>
        The Large practice room has upright piano and drum kit. One bass amp belongs to the JCR. Big Band and most
        productions use this. All other amps are privately owned and are stored AT STUDENTS OWN RISK.
        <br/>
        The small practice room has baby grand piano. Both practice rooms are wired into the control room. This
        has a 24-channel mixing desk and quad-core computer for making digital recordings and CDs. A range of
        microphones, stands and cables are available for making recordings.
        <br/>The Ustinov Room contains the Bechstein grand piano, built sometime between 1901-1914. It was recently
        restored and is available for use by JCR pianists of Grade 8 standard.
        <br/>
        Recitals are organised fairly regularly, giving students the opportunity to perform in public on this
        unique piano.
