      <p>
        Mildert’s College Shop aims to fulfil all of your snacking needs, and is located right next to the college
        bar. We sell a variety of confectionary, toasties, crisps, and drinks, as well as toiletries and household
        goods.
        <br/>The shop is run by the JCR Shop Committee, which is comprised of 7 members including the manager.
        Interviews to apply to be on shop are held over the summer each year once a manager is appointed in late
        easter term.
        <br/>Members work a weekly four hour shift, as well as holding an extra voluntary role, such as filling
        the vending machines, and running shop’s social media pages.
