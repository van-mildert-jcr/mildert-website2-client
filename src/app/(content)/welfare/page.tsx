    (The BEST college welfare committee in all of Durham - even if we do say so ourselves!)
  </p>
  <p>
    We are here to provide ALL Mildert students with the necessary
    welfare and support that they need throughout their degree.
    Want someone to talk to? Feeling homesick or upset? Worried about friends or things going on at home?
    Require FREE sexual health supplies? Need some guidance on the University counselling system?
    Weâ€™ve got you covered.
  </p>
  <p>
    We run Campaigns throughout the year to raise awareness of certain issues,
    and also operate a Pastoral branch which hold regular drop-ins and
    reply to messages and calls on anything you want to talk about.
