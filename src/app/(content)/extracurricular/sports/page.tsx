                </h3>
                <p>
                  At Durham sport can form as large a part of your lifestyle as you like; one of the fantastic
                  things about the Collegiate System is the availability of sport to everyone - in fact 90% of
                  Durham Students play sport at some point during their time here. Mildert has over thirty
                  different teams covering a whole range of sports so there is sure to be a team for you - whether
                  male or female, novice or pro, first year or finalist.

                  Countless Opportunities
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Whether you were a schoolboy international, or reluctantly trudged to games each week at school,
                  there will be a sport for you. Unlike other universities, where you often have to be in the top
                  tier of athletes to compete for your university or face limited intra-mural matches, Durham
                  provides a complete inter-collegiate league system. Mildert is no slouch in the annual league
                  championship, regularly finishing in the top few colleges across a range of sports.

                  Fantastic Socials
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Many of the sports we participate in at Mildert will be familiar to you from school, some of
                  them may be new to you - the fantastic thing about sport at Mildert is you can take part in any
                  sport you choose and at a level you feel comfortable with. All sports teams have regular socials
                  where club members can mingle and get to know one another away from the sports fields; clubs
                  also do their bit for the Mildert community, the annual Rugby Strip for DUCK (the University
                  charities body) is just one example.
