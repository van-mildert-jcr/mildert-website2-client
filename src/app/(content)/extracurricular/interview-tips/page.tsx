          You can take notes into the interview with you, so make sure you note down ideas for the questions
          you’ve thought about. We find questions are much more developed and detailed when the candidate has
          thought about ideas beforehand and has notes to remind them. It also shows preparation and gives the
          impression that you care about the role.

          Make sure you back up everything you say with an example, and I mean everything. If you can support
          your answer with hard evidence of a time you have demonstrated a particular skill, or why you have
          an interest in the position, you will look much more believable and competent, and the interviewers
          will be impressed! Remember, this doesn’t mean you have to have college experience! Anything you can
          think of that demonstrates useful skills will be valuable, and the interviewers know that not
          everyone (especially Freshers) has had the chance to gain college experience.
          <br /><br />• Bad Answer: “I would be perfect for the role as I am hardworking and reliable”
          <br />• Good Answer: “I would be perfect for the role as I am hardworking and reliable. I have
          demonstrated this in my work for the college shop, for which I have never missed a shift and have
          been given the responsibility of restocking by the manager due to their trust in me.”

          Highlight why what you have said applies to the position. There’s no point stating an example if you
          don’t explain what skills you learned and how you can apply them to the role you’re interviewing
          for.
          <br /><br />• Bad Answer: “I was a prefect at school and I had many responsibilities.”
          <br />• Good Answer: “I was a prefect at school, where I had to organise and implement a rota to make
          sure that events were run properly and to a particular budget. I delegated tasks to different
          members of my team, and as a result events such as the Sports Day went very well. I had lots of
          positive feedback from staff and parents. This taught me the importance of using all members of a
          team, and the value of forward planning, skills that I believe are vital in the position of
          Fresher’s Rep.”

          Even if it seems to go without saying, the candidate who goes into detail is more likely to come
          across as more suited to the role. This is particularly useful for (but not limited to) situational
          questions. You can’t be penalised for too much detail!
          <br /><br />• Bad Answer: “Go and help the person being sick.”
          <br />• Good Answer: “Go and assess the person being sick. If necessary, put them in the recovery
          position, and then call a member of welfare. If you see someone with first aid training, ask them to
          help. If the person still feels unwell, it may be wise to give them water. It might also be
          appropriate to take them back to their room, if they would like.”

          If you feel like your answer is unclear, it probably is! Sometimes explaining your thought process
          as you find the answer will be the best move. This will show the interviewer how you got to the
          answer and why you believe it to be correct. It also helps us to see how you think, and, for
          situational questions, how you would react and conduct yourself.
          <br /><br />Question: What is the most important quality for a this committee?
          <br /><br />• Bad Answer: “The most important quality is to be hardworking.”
          <br />• Good Answer: “There are many qualities that are important for this role. It is necessary to
          have good time management, a quality that I have displayed in my work on Team Bar, for which I have
          never missed a shift. Friendliness is also key, as you must be able to work well with those the
          committee is helping and provide a friendly face from the college. I have shown this in my pastoral
          work at school, for which I was a member of the pastoral committee for three years, greatly
          improving my interpersonal skills. The most important quality, however, is to be hardworking, as the
          role can at times be stressful and it is vital that the members are able to step up and support each
          other on the job. I have demonstrated my ability to do this when on CRC, being able to fill in for
          other volunteers if they are busy with academic work, and always committing myself to the project
          whenever I make a visit.”

          You do not have to jump in right away after a question, and we will remind you of that when you come
          into the interview. Often people don’t think about their answer and go straight into an answer that
          they had prepared for a question they were expecting, not the actual question! Taking a moment can
          help you to really see what the question is asking, and the answer the interviewer is looking for.
